      <p id="contentInfo"> I'm Vardhan Burse. My favourite hobby is coding. I like developing inovative applications. 
        Whenever my E-school completes, I start up my computer, sit on my bumpy gaming chair and start thinking which app should we develope today. And then start coding the app. And whenever I succesfully create the app, I become so joyful and happy that I give my friends a chocolate party. I like coding very much that some times I also quit playing with my friends. And I like it so much because It needs strong logic and that forces me to increase my logic and reasoning resulting in good performance in school too. And last but not the least because of coding we can make the way faster towards technology.
